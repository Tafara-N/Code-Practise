# Things to Do

- `4.1` Assign the value `7` to the variable `guess_me`. Then, write the conditional tests (if, else, and elif) to print the string `'too low'` if `guess_me` is `less` than 7, `'too high'` if `greater` than `7`, and `'just right'` if `equal` to `7`.

- `4.2` Assign the value `7` to the variable `guess_me` and the value `1` to the variable `start`. Write a while loop that compares `start` with `guess_me`. Print `too low` if `start` is less than `guess_me`. If `start` equals `guess_me`, print `'found it!'` and exit the loop. If `start` is greater than `guess_me`, print `'oops'` and exit the loop. Increment `start` at the end of the loop.

- `4.3` Use a for loop to print the values of the list `[3, 2, 1, 0]`.

- `4.4` Use a list comprehension to make a list of the `even` numbers in `range(10)`.

- `4.5` Use a dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary `squares`. Use `range(10)` to return the keys, and use the square of each key as its value.

- `4.6` Use a set comprehension to create the set `odd` from the odd numbers in `range(10)`.

- `4.7` Use a generator comprehension to return the string `'Got '` and a number for the numbers in `range(10)`. Iterate through this by using a for loop.

- `4.8` Define a function called `good` that returns the list `['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']`.

- `4.9` Define a generator function called `get_odds` that returns the odd numbers from `range(10)`. Use a for loop to find and print the third value returned.

- `4.10` Define a decorator called `test` that prints `'start'` when a function is called and `'end'` when it finishes.

- `4.11` Define an exception called `OopsException`. Raise this exception to see what happens. Then write the code to catch this exception and print `'Caught an oops'`.

- `4.12` Use `zip()` to make a dictionary called `movies` that pairs these lists: `titles` = `['Creature of Habit', 'Crewel Fate']` and `plots` = `['A nun turns into a monster', 'A haunted yarn shop']`.
