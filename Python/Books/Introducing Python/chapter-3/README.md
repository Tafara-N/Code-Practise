# Things to Do

In this chapter, you saw more complex data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Using these and those from Chapter 2 (numbers and strings), you can represent elements in the real world with great variety.

- `3.1`. Create a list called `years_list`, starting with the year of your birth, and each year thereafter until the year of your fifth birthday. For example, if you were born in 1980. the list would be `years_list` = `[1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985]`. If you’re less than five years old and reading this book, I don’t know what to tell you.

- `3.2`. In which year in `years_list` was your third birthday? Remember, you were `0` years of age for your first year.

- `3.3`. In which year in `years_list` were you the oldest?

- `3.4`. Make a list called `things` with these three strings as elements: `"mozzarella", "cinderella", "salmonella"`.

- `3.5`. Capitalize the element in `things` that refers to a `person` and then print the list. Did it change the element in the list?

- `3.6`. Make the `cheesy` element of `things` all uppercase and then print the list.

- `3.7`. Delete the `disease` element from `things`, collect your Nobel Prize, and print the list.

- `3.8`. Create a list called `surprise` with the elements `"Groucho", "Chico", and "Harpo"`.

- `3.9`. Lowercase the last element of the `surprise` list, reverse it, and then capitalize it.

- `3.10`. Make an English-to-French dictionary called `e2f` and print it. Here are your starter words: `dog` is `chien`, `cat` is `chat`, and `walrus` is `morse`.

- `3.11`. Using your three-word dictionary `e2f`, print the French word for `walrus`.

- `3.12`. Make a French-to-English dictionary called `f2e` from `e2f`. Use the `items` method.

- `3.13`. Using `f2e`, print the English equivalent of the French word `chien`.

- `3.14`. Make and print a set of English words from the keys in `e2f`.

- `3.15`. Make a multilevel dictionary called `life`. Use these strings for the topmost keys: `'animals'`, `'plants'`, and `'other'`. Make the `'animals'` key refer to another dictionary with the keys `'cats', 'octopi', and 'emus'`. Make the `'cats'` key refer to a list of strings with the values `'Henri', 'Grumpy', and 'Lucy'`. Make all the other keys refer to empty dictionaries.

- `3.16`. Print the top-level keys of life.

- `3.17`. Print the keys for `life['animals']`.

- `3.18`. Print the values for `life['animals']['cats']`.
