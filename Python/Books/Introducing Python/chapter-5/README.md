# Things to Do

- `5.1`. Create a file called `zoo.py`. In it, define a function called `hours()` that prints the string `'Open 9-5 daily'`. Then, use the interactive interpreter to import the zoo module and call its `hours()` function.

5.2. In the interactive interpreter, import the zoo module as menagerie and call its
hours() function.
5.3. Staying in the interpreter, import the hours() function from zoo directly and
call it.
5.4. Import the hours() function as info and call it.
5.5. Make a dictionary called plain with the key-value pairs 'a': 1, 'b': 2, and 'c':
3, and then print it.
5.6. Make an OrderedDict called fancy from the same pairs listed in 5.5 and print it.
Did it print in the same order as plain?

- `5.7`. Make a defaultdict called `dict_of_lists` and pass it the argument list. Make the list `dict_of_lists['a']` and append the value `'something for a'` to it in one assignment. Print `dict_of_lists['a']`.
