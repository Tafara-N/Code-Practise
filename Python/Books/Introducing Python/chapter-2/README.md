# Things to Do

This chapter introduced the atoms of Python: numbers, strings, and variables. Letâ€™s try a few small exercises with them in the interactive interpreter.

- `2.1` How many seconds are in an hour? Use the interactive interpreter as a calculator and multiply the number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (also 60).

- `2.2` Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable called `seconds_per_hour`.

- `2.3` How many seconds are in a day? Use your `seconds_per_hour` variable.

- `2.4` Calculate seconds per day again, but this time save the result in a variable called `seconds_per_day`.

- `2.5` Divide `seconds_per_day` by `seconds_per_hour`. Use floating-point (`/`) division.

- `2.6` Divide `seconds_per_day` by `seconds_per_hour`, using integer (`//`) division. Did this number agree with the floating-point value from the previous question, aside from the final .0?
