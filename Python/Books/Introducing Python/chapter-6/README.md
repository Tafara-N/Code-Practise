# Things to Do

- `6.1`. Make a class called `Thing` with no contents and print it. Then, create an object called `example` from this class and also print it. Are the printed values the same or different?

- `6.2`. Make a new class called `Thing2` and assign the value `'abc'` to a class attribute called `letters`. Print `letters`.

- `6.3`. Make yet another class called, of course, `Thing3`. This time, assign the value `'xyz'` to an instance (object) attribute called `letters`. Print `letters`. Do you need to make an object from the class to do this?

- `6.4`. Make a class called `Element`, with instance attributes `name`, `symbol`, and `number`. Create an object of this class with the values `'Hydrogen'`, `'H'`, and `1`.

- `6.5`. Make a dictionary with these keys and values: `'name': 'Hydrogen'`, `'symbol': 'H'`, `'number': 1`. Then, create an object called `hydrogen` from class `Element` using this dictionary.

- `6.6`. For the `Element` class, define a method called `dump()` that prints the values of the objectâ€™s attributes (`name`, `symbol`, and `number`). Create the `hydrogen` object from this new definition and use `dump()` to print its attributes.

- `6.7`. Call print(hydrogen). In the definition of Element, change the name of method
dump to __str__, create a new hydrogen object, and call print(hydrogen) again.

- `6.8`. Modify Element to make the attributes name, symbol, and number private. Define a
getter property for each to return its value.

- `6.9`. Define three classes: Bear, Rabbit, and Octothorpe. For each, define only one
method: eats(). This should return 'berries' (Bear), 'clover' (Rabbit), or
'campers' (Octothorpe). Create one object from each and print what it eats.

- `6.10`. Define these classes: Laser, Claw, and SmartPhone. Each has only one method:
does(). This returns 'disintegrate' (Laser), 'crush' (Claw), or 'ring' (Smart
Phone). Then, define the class Robot that has one instance (object) of each of these.
Define a does() method for the Robot that prints what its component objects do.
