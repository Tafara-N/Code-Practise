# Things to Do

This chapter was an introduction to the Python language—what it does, how it looks, and where it fits in the computing world. At the end of each chapter, I’ll suggest some mini-projects to help you remember what you just read and prepare you for what’s to come.

- `1.1` If you don’t already have `Python 3` installed on your computer, do it now. Visit [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for the details for your computer system.

- `1.2` Start the `Python 3` interactive interpreter. Again, details are in Appendix D. It should print a few lines about itself and then a single line starting with `>>>`. That’s your prompt to type `Python` commands.

- `1.3` Play with the interpreter a little. Use it like a calculator and type this: `8 * 9`. Press the `Enter` key to see the result. Python should print `72`.

- `1.4` Type the number `47` and press the `Enter` key. Did it print `47` for you on the next line?

- `1.5` Now, type `print(47)` and press `Enter`. Did that also print `47` for you on the next line?
